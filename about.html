          <h1>about me</h1>
          <p>I am currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a major in Marketing and a minor in Creative Technology & Design. I graduate in May of 2023 and am excited to work in the tech industry. I am currently a Marketing and Design intern at Acceldata and am planning to continue to work there during the summer of 2022.</p>
          <p> Outside of school and work, I enjoy drawing, playing guitar, and skiing. I also love anything that is strawberry flavored.</p>
